##  Learning Path

###  Foundations
Started with the basics of data analysis and exploration:
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** - Understanding data distributions and patterns
- **Feature Engineering** - Creating meaningful features from raw data
- **Pandas Profiling** - Automated data analysis and reporting

###  Data Engineering
Learned to collect and process data from various sources:
- Working with APIs and CSV/TSV files
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Database integration with MySQL and JSON

###  Supervised Learning

#### Regression Models
Progressed through regression techniques:
1. **Simple Linear Regression** - Single variable predictions
2. **Multi-Variate Regression** - Multiple features
3. **Polynomial Regression** - Non-linear relationships
4. **Ridge & Lasso Regression** - Regularization techniques
5. **Elastic Net & GridSearch** - Advanced optimization

#### Classification Models
Explored various classification algorithms:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning
- **Decision Trees** - Tree-based decisions
- **Random Forest & SVM** - Ensemble and kernel methods
- **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classification
- **Logistic Regression** - Binary and multi-class classification
- **LDA/QDA** - Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

###  Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering** - Pattern discovery without labels

###  Neural Networks
- **Backpropagation** - Core deep learning algorithm
- **Find-S Algorithm** - Concept learning basics

###  Computer Vision
- **Background Subtraction** - Motion detection using unimodel background modeling
- Worked with 1,000+ image dataset for real-world CV applications
